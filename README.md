# Hospital Management System Frontend

This is the frontend app for the Hospital Management System.

## Prerequisite

Make sure you have `nodejs` installed (version 14+).

Also, a local backend can be used. The repositiory to the backend is [here](https://github.com/aneeshsharma/HospitalManagementBackend/)

Or, you can switch to the hosted backend from the `src/endpoint.js` file. Use the "production" server for the backend.

## Starting the app locally

Clone the repository using -

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aneeshsharma/HospitalManagementFrontend
```

Now, change to the directory and install the dependencies

```
$ cd HospitalManagementFrontend
$ npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, start the app using -

```
$ npm start
```
